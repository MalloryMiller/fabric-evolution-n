# Spectral orientation fabric model for polycrystals
A spectral fabric model for polycrystalline materials (e.g. ice, olivine, etc.) that 
- Can model fabric processes such as kinematic lattice (c-axis) rotation (Svendsen and
Hutter, 1996), discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (Placidi and others, 2010), and rotation recrystallization (GÃ¶dert, 2003).
- Can calculate fabric-induced directional viscosities (directional strain-rate enhancement factors) using Sachs/Taylor homogenization schemes.
- Contains analytical expressions for both forward and inverse anisotropic rheologies such as the transversely isotropic rheology and the orthotropic rheology.

## Contains
- Modules for Fortran (`make specfab.o`) and Python (`make specfabpy`).
- Demos for Fortran (`make fabric-evolution-demo`) and Python (`make specfabpy`).

All `make` commands must be executed in `/src`. Demos are located in `/demo`.

## Q&A
- **Q** What *L* are possible?
  - **A** Any 4<=*L*<=20. If higher *L* are required:
    1. `cd src/include && python3 make_gaunt_coefs.py L` (replacing *L*)
    2. `make clean && make`
